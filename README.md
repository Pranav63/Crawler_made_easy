This is a spider built using BeautifulSoup(obvious) for scraping websites. 
Simple enough , run the code on an IDE or an editor with requests and Bs4 module installed . Hard code the website name you wish to scrape and add the number of pages you want it to ramble on . The first function is primarily for the home page and the single_page() is for each and every page it next moves onto .
